- Don't use distributed logger macro syntax
- Use example_io_app as explicit reference
- Follow exact usage in example_io_app of DDS API's
- Follow exact usage in example_io_app of DDSContextSetup API usage
- Follow exact usage in example_io_app of DDSReaderSetup and DDSWriterSetup API usage
- Follow exact usage of Distributed Logger api from example_io_app
- Clean and make DDS library after adding new data type
- Make sure all types are regenerated and included in headers
- Make sure connext DDS environment variables are set
- Make sure specific compiler flags are used from reference cmakelists
- Copy the cmakelists from the reference directory and modify as necessary
- **CRITICAL: When copying CMakeLists.txt, copy ALL directory paths EXACTLY from example_io_app/CMakeLists.txt**
- **ONLY change: project name, executable name (add_executable), target names (target_include_directories, target_link_libraries, etc), and source filenames**
- **DO NOT modify any of these paths from example_io_app/CMakeLists.txt:**
  - `DDS_BUILD_DIR` - must remain `dds/build`
  - `DDS_CODEGEN_DIR` - must remain `dds/build/cxx11_gen`
  - `DDS_UTILS_DIR` - must remain `dds/utils/cxx11`
  - `DDS_TYPESUPPORT_LIB` - must remain `dds_typesupport`
- **DO NOT use paths from workspace structure context - ONLY use paths from example_io_app/CMakeLists.txt**
- Make example code as simple as reference example app with zero application logic
- If only new data type is referenced and the topic has been created for it create a new topicname with TYPE+Topic syntax format
- Use DefaultParticipantQoS if none specified
- Use ASSIGNER_QOS as default of none specified
- If ASSIGNER_QOS is used, add a TODO comment to the code to make new assignment in XML file
- Before building application perform a full review of code and verify all fields for data members are accurate
- Never use rtime-make to build
- Ensure consistency of Connext versions when generating and building code
